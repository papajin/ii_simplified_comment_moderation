title: WP Simplified Comment Auto Moderation Plugin
description: There is the Wordpress option which, when selected, permits comment to appear automatically, if the commenter has a previously approved comment. By default, wordpress tries to match both the name AND email of the commenter to see if they have commented before. This is annoying because sometimes people will use a different name like Ihor one day, Ihor I. the next, etc. and the admin has to approve all the variations of peoples' names. This plugin makes WordPress to match ONLY on the email address and not the name.
